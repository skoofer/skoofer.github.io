Richard Fidler goes on a journey to Istanbul in 2014 with his teenage son. Whilst he is telling us about their journey in the contemporary Istanbul going on a hunt for the relics of the ancient city, he also begins telling the history, tales and legends of the city.

The story begins even before Constantine I came to Byzantium —from whom the city will eventually take its name. It begins with the path how Constantine the Great becomes a Roman emperor and the events which leads to him settling in the small city of Byzantium. From there, till the fall of Constantinople when Mehmed II (the Conqueror) takes the city and puts an end to the Byzantine Empire, the history of Constantinople is told in a chronological order including many Emperors and Empresses, political & religious struggles, relics such as Hagia Sophia, and many tales and legends.

I enjoyed how Richard Fidler combined the history of Constantinople with his and his son's journey in the contemporary Istanbul. I was able to relate to their struggle trying to connect to the ancient city as I lived in Istanbul for many years. It was also very interesting to see Istanbul in their perception. For instance, having Atatürk portraits on the walls of the shops is quite common in Turkey to pay respects to the founder of modern Turkey. While it is completely free of any kind of political pressure, I can see how Richard's son —a teenager who lacks context— can interpret it very differently and compares it with a supreme leader, like Kim Jong-il, for whom you <b>must</b> pay respects.

This book should definitely go on your list if you are even remotely interested in the Eastern Roman Empire (a.k.a. Byzantine Empire), legends of one of the capitals of the civilization of that era or early Christianity power struggles.

Finally, it is <b>Istanbul not Constantinople</b> :)

My rating: 9/10
