A film by Richard Linklater with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy as the leading actors, which tells the story of two people from different continents who meet on a train and suddenly start an adventure on Vienna streets. Knowing they have to part ways the next morning, they try make the best of their time. As they are trying to get to know each other as much as they possibly can in their very limited time, they also explore their ideas on things like love, relationships, happiness and more.

The chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is extraordinary. The fact that they almost re-wrote the script together --even though they are not credited for it-- must have contributed this chemistry a lot. The pinball machine scene was impressive where they are in a very deep and engaging discussion during which they are actually playing the pinball machine and changing hands. It shows how concentrated and committed they are together.

The film tells two different stories on two different levels. On the surface, it is a "love at first sight" story where we see how perfect they fit each other and how much fun they have together; but also waiting anxiously whether they are actually going to go their own ways never to be seen by one another, or they will give up and stay in touch. However, below the surface, we see many engaging philosophical discussions --often contradicting each other-- between them. It keeps the magical love story on the surface for drama purposes while touching upon interesting ideas about hard questions such as what love and happiness is about.

It is the perfect "love story"; simply because they know it is until sunrise. They are free from the burden of what is going to happen with them the next day. That's why they agreed on not attempting to turn this into a long distance relationship since neither of them willing to give up on their local lives. When they decide to see each other, the magical premise of their relationship shatters. There can be two possible reasons why they decided to see each other again, even though it contradicts the nature of their relationship; either to show us that they are human after all and they will sign up for this relationship even though they know it is doomed by distances, or more financial concerns around a possible sequel. I hope the believe it is the former one.

This is not just a romantic film that just tells a simple love story. It is much more than that with the rich ideas and discussions around several philosophical questions regarding love and happiness.

Score: 7.5/10
