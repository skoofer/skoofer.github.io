In this book, Professor Cal Newport shows us how the new technologies turned into a behavioral addiction where every like, comment, tag is a little "hit" that substitutes the social approval feeling. He offers a way to take back the control with Digital Minimalism: A philosophy that essentially states 'less is more' when it comes to technology. He describes a 'digital clutter' process to kick-start it, and also suggests several ways, together with testimonials from already digital minimalist people, to help you sustain this digital minimalist way.

Cal Newport did a great job in terms of storytelling. The way he diagnosed the problem and the solutions offered are clear, strong and convincing. However, one thing I can criticize is that he relied heavily on testimonials from people about how Digital Minimalism worked very well for them, which tells us only one side of the story. They are all inspiring stories that I took lessons for myself from each of them; but I expected to see a few counter examples where this philosophy did not work on those people as expected and why it was the case. I believe there would have been great lessons for us in those kind of testimonials too.

In 2020 summer, when outdoor and social activities are very limited, and people are using their smartphones even more to just 'pass the time', this book adds even a greater value by conveying the message: We should use the technology in our advantage; not end up being used by it.

If you think our relationship with the new technology, especially with social media, is not healthy and sustainable anymore, this book is just for you. 

My rating: 9/10
