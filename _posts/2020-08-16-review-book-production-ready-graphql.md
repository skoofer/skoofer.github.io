Production Ready GraphQL makes a brief introduction to GraphQL and then covers almost all aspects of it briefly with an emphasis on the Server side of things. Schema Design topic in particular, which is how I know Marc-André from his talks on this topic, is covered very thoroughly as expected. The aim of this book is to give you all the necessary knowledge and suggestions/lessons when building GraphQL Servers.

Marc-André shares very valuable lessons on GraphQL from his years of hands-on experience at Shopify and GitHub, which are the two biggest public GraphQL APIs at the moment. I like the fact that these suggestions are not only hypothetical; but all lessons learned from real life experiences. That can already give you insight about why something is a good, but especially is not a good idea.

Although it has very good information and lessons in it, it gives you the feeling that it is more of a compilation of blog posts than a book. I must say I felt the lack of a structure and a "story"; which made me feel like I was reading Marc-André's blog posts one after another. Individually they are quite good and complete; but together they don't make up a complete book with a structure and story.

This book may not be the starting point for people who are absolutely beginners to GraphQL; but for people who are already building GraphQL APIs for some time and wants to do it right, this book is one of the reference books on server side GraphQL.

My rating: 8/10
