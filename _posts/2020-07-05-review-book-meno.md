This is a dialogue mainly between Socrates and Meno later written by Plato. Socrates and Meno inquiry what virtue is and whether it can be taught.

Socrates, as always, arguing that he knows not about what virtue is; and after many engaging discussions convinces Meno that we cannot know the true nature of virtue. His main argument is that if it is something that can be taught, then there should be scholars, teachers and disciples; but there are not. Secondly, if it can be taught, then we should expect sons of virtuous men to be have the same virtues as well —it is only natural to expect fathers want their sons to have virtues— but there are many examples proving that is not the case.

Socrates uses of an analogy to the geometric method of analysis in order to get make his argument more sound. Here, even though Socrates claims he knows nothing, we also see how much he knows about geometry so that he can use it as an analogy.

They conclude that virtue is not knowledge therefore cannot be taught. It is the about having the right opinions; but it is not acquired on purpose. It is a gift of god. There are virtuous people but they don't know exactly what it is.

This book is for people who wants to know more about the philosophy of Socrates, especially his ideas about virtue.

My rating: 8/10
