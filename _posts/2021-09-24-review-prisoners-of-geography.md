If the term "Geopolitics" is basically the influence of Geography on Politics, Prisoners of Geography by Tim Marshall should be regarded as an "Introduction to Geopolitics". The subtitle of the book "Ten Maps That Tell You Everything You Need to Know About Global Politics" is quite descriptive and exactly captures the essence of it. Tim Marshall masterfully covers ten regions of the world â€”from the hot regions such as the Middle East and Korea to the more subtle regions such as the Arctic and Latin America.

In each region, we are given the description of the terrain itself, some history, who the players are and how all these have had impact on the politics in the region. I liked this style for it gives you a coherent story. The influence of Geography on the Politics in the regions usually make sense; but in one instance (i.e. Middle East) it seemed far-fetched to me. I agree that the Geographical knowledge colonial powers of the West, or lack thereof, had a huge impact on the politics of the Middle East; but it simply cannot explain everything. I would expect him at least to have mentioned how western colonialism and rush to oil shaped the Middle East as we know today, and the borders drawn and nation-states created arbitrarily fueled the turmoil.

As a geography enthusiast and someone who is interested in global politics, this book was tailor-made for me. It is ambitious to tackle Geopolitics of the world in about 300 pages; but Tim Marshall did a good job scratching the surface enough to give you a good start. 

My rating: 9/10
