The Wisdom of Insecurity is a philosophical book by Alan Watts with the premise of guiding people in their search for "meaning" in an age of anxiety. First published in 1951 when the level of anxiety in the world reached to a level for this book to be written as a guide; but it is still nothing compared to the anxiety levels of 21<sup>st</sup> century social media age people, which makes this book maybe even more relevant today compared to 70 years ago.

Watts argues human beings constantly seek for the security feeling for future at the cost of missing out on "now". This search for a better future where they will be more happy becomes what actually makes them more insecure and unhappy in the first place. Watts tries to explain in a simple way that this conundrum can be only solved by if people let go of the future and live in the "now".

Insecurity notion is maybe one-third of the book where the majority of it covers experiencing the "now" as it is, as a whole; as opposed to splitting ourselves into two selves: experiencing self and the self who is thinking about the experience. He argues this constant struggle of thinking about the experience instead of just experiencing is what drives people into the hands of an "unhappy" life.

Most of the book was too vague —especially in the parts where it repeatedly argues the only way to "salvation" is to experience the "now" as a whole without thinking— for my "rational" taste as arguing the same thing over and over again does not make that argument stronger.

Although Alan Watts is the foremost interpreter of the Eastern thought, Zen Buddhism in particular, to the West; in this book he doesn't even attempt to "sell" any named religion or spiritual doctrine whatsoever. This is not a Buddhist 101 sort of book. It is rather a manifestation of his philosophy on how we can make a difference in our lives if we are able to let go of our future-thinking selves and focus on the "now" instead.


My rating: 5/10
