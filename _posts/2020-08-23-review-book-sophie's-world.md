Sophie, a 14 year-old girl in Norway receives a mysterious letter and her journey to learn about Philosophy begins. While she is getting introduced to Philosophy, from Pre-Socratic era to 20th Century Philosophy, she also tries to solve the mystery of another girl, Hilde, whose letters are copied to Sophie.

This book has two main story lines: Sophie and her adventures that revolve around her mysterious Philosophy teacher Alberto Knox and another mysterious girl Hilde whose letters Sophie receives. Meanwhile, Alberto Knox and Sophie have very informative dialogues regarding Philosophy and Philosophers throughout the history. The two story lines are in a very good balance. The aim of the book is to introduce Philosophy to us, and the mystery about Alberto and Hilde makes the it not a "boring text book" about Introduction to Philosophy. Major part of the book which educational is glued together with a mystery novel.

Most of the book is in dialogue format, which takes place between Sophie (i.e. student) and Alberto (i.e. teacher). In many cases, when something didn't make sense exactly, or I had a follow up question, I realized Sophie already asks the same question, on behalf of me, in the next few lines. This was a brilliant method to make the reading a continuous experience by reducing the times you need to stop and go back to read it again to understand.

The book covers almost all eras of Philosophy and stories of many great Philosophers throughout the history. Since it is not reasonable to cover all Philosophers extensively in one single book, it only scratches the surface. However this is not necessarily a bad thing. This book gives you only an introduction per Philosopher, so that you can go deep on the topics of your interest externally.

I must say I was able to find the book only on "Young Adults" section at my bookstore, though it is for people of all ages. There is nothing makes this book exclusive for "Young Adults" other than it being an introduction to Philosophy.

My rating: 10/10
