This is a story of a 40-year-old former officer —the narrator— living in his basement in St. Petersburg. "The underground man" tells us how he is alienated from society and ended up living in "underground". It consists of two parts: first is a monologue from the viewpoint of a 40-year-old spiteful man living in underground, and the second is a haunting memory of him, a very short section of his life that captures his mindset perfectly, back when he was 24.

When I started noting down his character traits, I realized it had the potential to be an endless list. This is a man who thinks he is an intellectual, cultivated and conscious man unlike everyone around him. He is not modest at all, and thinks he is better than all without doubt. However he has never attained social acceptance, mostly because he is an extremely introvert and insecure man with an inferiority complex. Ultimately he drove himself away from society and became a spiteful man so that even loving meant being morally superior to someone. Despite all, he is honest to himself, sometimes even to the extreme. While I was reading his story, I was angry at him, sympathized with him, happy for him, felt sorry for him, wanted to go to St. Petersburg and confront him...

It is clear that Dostoyevsky is a master of human psychology. Several times this book made me stop, think carefully and question myself.

Recommended for anyone who is into psychology. Though keep in mind despite being a short book in number of pages, it is not a short read.

My rating: 10/10
