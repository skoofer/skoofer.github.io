Seconds away from the Earth is being demolished to clear the way for a galactic highway construction, Arthur Dent is saved by his friend Fort Prefect and together they begin their journey through space and their encounters with various space creatures and interesting situations they put themselves in. Sounds very absurd, right? Well... it is exactly that!

This is a classic from Douglas Adams which brings absurd comedy and science fiction together. First of all this is a science fiction novel but also a quite fun read. The comedy in there is utterly absurd â€”in a good way if you are a fan of absurdity in comedy like myself; otherwise the humor aspect will not appeal to you. That is why people either love HG2G or they don't.

If you are new to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy world, you will be surprised by the number of things you recognize from popular culture, art, engineering etc. which are named after Douglas Adams' creations in this book. The most striking one for me was Babel, a JavaScript Transpiler which I am familiar with due to my work, which now makes perfect sense why it was named Babe. Once-famous IBM's chess computer Deep Thought, and it's answer "42" to the question: "Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything". Finally my favorite character Marvin the Paranoid Android, which gives its name to the song by Radiohead in their album OK Computer (1997) which happens to be an album I very much like. More surprisingly later I learned "OK Computer" album name is also coming from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy BBC radio show. 

This is definitely a good choice if you would like to enjoy a science fiction which is also a lot fun. However, if absurdity in comedy is not something for you, you may find this boring.

My rating: 9/10
