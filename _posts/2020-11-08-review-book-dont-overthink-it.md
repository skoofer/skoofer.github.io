In her book "Don't Overthink It", Anne Bogel, a blogger and a podcaster, tries to tackle a major problem a lot of people suffer from: Overthinking. She walks us through the thought patterns which leads to overthinking, and offers practical tips from day-to-day life that can be applied to overcome them.

It is a 217 page, very easy-to-read book. The language used is casual, as if it is a collection of blog posts. On the other hand, the last chapters of the book are in a way that a few distantly related blog posts appended to the book so that it is long enough to be published.

The writer followed a consistent story telling method where she introduces something and backs it by an example story from her life or from the life of one of her family & friends. This method makes sense for certain topics covered in the book; but it is far-fetch for several topics and after a while it becomes repetitive. It could have been shorter and still able to give the same message.

All the aspects of the notion of Overthinking covered in this book are mainly from the writer's point of view, and the tips that comes with them are also from her own experience. There are very limited number of ideas presented here that are backed by scientific studies.

Although there are hints especially early in the book that the audience is women, but in fact it's not exactly. The audience is anyone who is suffering from overthinking, and seeking easy-to-apply tips.

My rating: 5/10
