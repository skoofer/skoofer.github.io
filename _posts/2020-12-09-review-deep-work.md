Deep Work, according the Computer Science Professor Cal Newport, is any activity that is done in a state of distraction free concentration that pushes our cognitive capabilities to their limit, and creates new values that are hard to replicate. Although it sounds straightforward and easy to achieve, it is argued that Deep Work is becoming extremely rare and very valuable.

This book breaks down the notion of Deep Work and analyzes why it is valuable, rare and meaningful. It also makes it very clear how the Internet is changing our lives on many fronts as well as our capability of performing deep work. The Internet changed our way of life, and it changed how we work. Emails, instant messages, social media are all adding value into our social and work lives; but at a cost usually overlooked: constant distraction.

Not only it defines what Deep Work is and is not at length, but it also provides lots of practical tips to help us cultivate deep work habits. Most of them are very basic ideas; but turning them into habits is the challenge. That is acknowledged clearly in this book, and the tips are catered keeping that in mind. 

In one of the chapters, Cal Newport suggests we should quit Social Media. Though this is a provocative statement, the idea was recognized by many; and he based his next book —[Digital Minimalism](https://serkanolgun.me/2020/06/30/review-book-digital-minimalism.html)— on that premise.

This book is mostly for knowledge workers who are struggling with utilizing their time, and anyone who wants to move their work from "Shallow" into "Deep" in order to generate more value.

My rating: 7/10
