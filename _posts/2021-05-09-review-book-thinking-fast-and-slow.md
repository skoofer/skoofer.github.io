In his acclaimed book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, psychologist and economist Daniel Kahneman explains how we humans think. He argues we have two systems in action when we think: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is automatic, intuitive, behind-the-scenes and works super fast. System 2, however, is the slow one. This is the rational part of our thinking process though it is also lazy.

Besides the concepts of System 1 and 2, several concepts about how humans work, such as Anchoring, Availability, Loss Aversion,Framing, Sunk Costs. These biases and fallacies are all innate within us and they surface when System 1 is in action.

I like how all the concepts introduced in the book are backed by extensive studies either by the years of collaboration of Kahneman and Tversky, or other renowned scientists in the field of psychology and economics. Each chapter ends with quotes from the real world that exemplifies the concept introduced in the chapter, which helps great to put it in perspective.

Daniel Kahneman is expert in behavioral economics and the book mentions a lot about behavioral economics; but this is not an economics or business book per se. It is more about how human brain works especially at times of decisions, which is, of course, also in the domain of behavioral economics on which Kahneman is an expert. So, if you are generally interested in how human brain works at times of decisions, and even remotely interested in behavioral economics, this will be the go-to book for you.

My rating: 9/10
