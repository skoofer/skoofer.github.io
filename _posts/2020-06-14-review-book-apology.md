### Anything but an Apology

This is the of speech of Socrates during his trial, later written by Plato, where he is facing charges of being "doer of evil, who corrupts the youth; and who does not believe in the gods of the state."

Through Socrates' statements, we get a glimpse of the Ancient Greek, its society, and how judiciary system works.

During his defense, Socrates is not only trying to prove his innocence; but also in a way, he tries to justify his way of living: questioning everything and everyone around him even though it makes them uncomfortable or even threatened. The latter, indeed, what brings him to into that day at the trial.

In his opening statement, he starts his arguments against Meletus with a fallacy (Tu quoque) when he accuses Meletus being a "doer of evil"; and then followed by another one (Ad hominem) when he tries to discredit Meletus with "that Meletus is reckless and impudent, and that he has written this indictment in a spirit of mere wantonness and youthful bravado." One can that argue that he went down that road because he knew his arguments were not be enough for the audience or he wanted to cut corners due to lack of time —as he also admitted he would have convinced them if he had more time—.

What brings him down is not being an atheist or corrupting the youth; but the fact that he threatens the beliefs of his fellow citizens on religion, ethics, justice etc. by constantly questioning them. Ironically he believes this is what makes him a good man in front of gods, and what makes him to be at peace with the sentence.

He is a man wise enough to admit that he knows not much; and seeks out and confronts people who claims to know a lot. In his closing statement, he asks his friends to make sure his sons put riches before virtue; and troubles —questions— them. In a way this is his legacy.

This book is for anyone who wants to get a glimpse of Ancient Athens at a key moment time for philosophy and history: The trial of Socrates (399 BC).

My rating: 9/10
