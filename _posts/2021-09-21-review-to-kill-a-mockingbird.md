To Kill a Mockingbird is an American novel by Harper Lee first published in 1960. It is regarded as a classic of the American literature and has been quite popular since then.

The story is from the viewpoint of Scout, a six-year old girl, living in a small Alabama town in Southern America during the great depression era. Through her, her older brother Jem and her father Atticus Fitch, Harper Lee makes us experience a simple small-town life in length. The trial of a black man who is charged with a crime against a white woman is at the epicenter of the story. Next to the storyline however, we witness Scout's struggles growing up as a girl, Jem's steps towards being a grown man following the footsteps of his father, Atticus' courageous stance against injustice, and most importantly racism against black people.

It makes me deeply sad that this book is timeless, because same kind of racism still exists in the world today in 2021. I hope this book will not be "relevant" anymore in the near future!

My rating: 9/10
