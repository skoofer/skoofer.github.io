James Barr's book "A Line in the Sand: Britain, France and the Struggle that Shaped the Middle East" as the name suggests tells the story of Middle East starting from the Great War until after the Arabâ€“Israeli War especially focusing on the involvement of Britain and France in particular with good reason for these colonial powers were behind all the newly created nation states, their borders and all the conflicts that were born out of it.

James Barr argues that Britain and France, as these colonial powers always do, drew arbitrary lines on the map while totally ignoring the geography and local political & cultural dynamics of the region. History proved once again that it never works out the way they think it would. Many conflicts and wars in the region, to this day, are born out of the colonial rivalry between Britain and France. A race to influence later oil what made them use the people of the region from different cultural and religious background as pawns on the chess board. Even after so many years these powers left the area, the scar is so deep that Middle East is still one of the most unstable regions in the worlds with several active ongoing conflicts and wars.

As a British writer, James Barr generally did a good job not to hold himself back against Britain in their involvement. I had a slight anticipation of a biased story; but he was able to maintain a level of objectivity throughout the book. You can expect a well-written story-like book backed with facts based on letters, documents etc. 

As someone growing up in Turkey being familiar with its history, this book made me reflect on Turkey's journey in the first half of the 20th century. Firstly, I am grateful to the founding fathers of the Republic of Turkey to rid themselves of all pro-mandate political agenda and people, and most importantly grateful to them for firmly standing up against Britain and France for an unconditional independence. Secondly, I am grateful to the Anatolian soil for not having oil reserves profitable enough for the Western colonial powers to "bring democracy" to Turkey.

My rating: 9/10
