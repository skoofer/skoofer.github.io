After a plane crash, a group of boys are the only survivors in an uninhabited island. There are no grown-ups, no authority or no form of government. What starts as a fun adventure for this group of children, quickly turns into challenges of forming a basic society —aimed to survive and get rescued— such as power struggles, conflict of interests and ethics.

In this fictional situation, an Hobbesian <b>State of Nature</b> comes to life. According to Thomas Hobbes, in a State of Nature there is no state or government of any sorts, no right or wrong, no moral or immoral; and people act in their own interests using the faculty of reason. Hobbes claims that a State of Nature eventually results in constant conflicts, and even a civil war. Hobbes suggests that the way out is a totalitarian sovereign (Leviathan) which can establish and enforce the law and justice without any opposition. In Lord of the Flies, a group of boys find themselves in a State of Nature, and then conflicts arise over the limited resources (i.e. manpower, fire, food). There is no good or evil in them; but they are just acting in their own interests according to what makes sense to them. We see two different ideals —revolving around Ralph and Jack— clashing against each other that results into a totalitarian regime whilst chaos makes way for order.

Despite all the conflicts, the story masterfully avoids from presenting pure good and evil characters. It tries to shatter the image of children as pure innocence, and portrays them just as they are: human beings.

Story development works very well except for the end where a Deus Ex Machina is introduced abruptly and needlessly. It made me wish to have missed the last few pages.

This is a provocative, and maybe even disturbing; but also a brave book, especially considering the time it was published. Although it is a story of a group of children, it is definitely not a children's book. Recommended as a dystopian novel, and also as an experiment of Hobbesian Philosophy.

My rating: 8/10
