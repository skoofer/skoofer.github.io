This book is an attempt to define the undefinable: Populism. Not only it establishes the definition and characteristics of Populism, but also it tells us about what do populists do in order to obtain political power, and then remain in power using (unfortunately) many recent examples from Populist parties and leaders around the world. Finally it touches upon a few suggestions on how to deal with Populism.

The most surprising for me —as someone who has lived almost all his adult life under Erdogan's regime— was the fact that Erdogan is a textbook —in this case this book— populist; and he is not alone in this. Many populist leaders across the world had almost identical steps in gaining the power and measures to perpetuate it.

Be aware that the language in this book may be slightly harder for someone outside of political or social sciences field (e.g., a Software Engineer), as it contains many Latin phrases and references. for which some time needs to be allocated for research.

The premise at the beginning of the book regarding there are ways to deal with Populism was promising. However, at the end, the ways to deal with Populism disappointingly doesn't go beyond "Don't do Populism in order to deal with Populism".

Populism, in one form or another, has a major impact on the World politics at the moment and it is not going to go down easily. This book is for people who wants to understand Populism, its characteristics, examples and some suggestions how to confront it. However do not expect a silver bullet against Populism in this book, since there is no any.

My rating: 6/10
