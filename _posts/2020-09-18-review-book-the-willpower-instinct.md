The Willpower Instinct is a scientific deep dive into the notions of willpower and self-control. At the same time, it is a self-guide for tackling your willpower challenges. Kelly McGonigal, in fact, taught this as a course at Stanford University for years which later she turned into a book while keeping a very similar format.

Each chapter covers one aspect of willpower by first scientifically explaining its relation to the human brain evolution and the physiology behind it —each backed by scientific studies—, and then student testimonials to see how it actually affects people in real-life, and finally a few suggestions which can be tried to overcome the challenges people are struggling with. These parts complement each other in a very brilliant way so that you can understand the issue, see the effects of it on people, and do experiments on yourself.

This is definitely not a cheesy self-help book. About 25% of the book is the references to the scientific studies mentioned in the chapters.

It is in a format so that every chapter is one lesson of the course. That makes it easy to break it into chapters and go through them separately on your own pace.

The Willpower Instinct is for people who want to understand how human brain works regarding willpower and self-control. Not only that, but also it is a self-help guide for people who want to overcome an addiction, cultivate a behavior or just try a willpower challenge.

My rating: 10/10
