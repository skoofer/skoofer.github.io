A journey with Socrates during this last days in this world. Well... at least for his body.

This is a series of conversations, and most importantly a speech by Socrates during his trial. In these four significant moments in time, tell us a great deal about Socrates' last days; but also his views on piety, justice, integrity and soul.

Euthyphro:
A discussion about justice, religion and piety between Socrates and Euthyphro. Euthyphro suggests being pious goes hand in hand with being just and has no hesitation when he files a complaint about his father's wrongdoing. Then Socrates encourages him to formulize what is good and what is bad in front of gods; but Euthyphro fails to do so. Though Socrates claims his motivation is to get some definitive answers from Euthyphro about piety iso that he can use them when he defends himself against Meletos's "slander", in fact, he just wants to prove Euthyphro that there are no clear-cut answers for these philosophical questions and that he is just being hypocrite by blaming his father according to his own beliefs on justice and gods.

Apology:
Socrates is facing charges of being "doer of evil, who corrupts the youth; and who does not believe in the gods of the state."
During his defense, Socrates is not only trying to prove his innocence; but also in a way, he tries to justify his way of living: questioning everything and everyone around him even though it makes them uncomfortable or even threatened. The latter, indeed, what brings him to into that day at the trial.
What brings him down is not being an atheist or corrupting the youth; but the fact that he threatens the beliefs of his fellow citizens on religion, ethics, justice etc. by constantly questioning them. Ironically he believes this is what makes him a good man in front of gods, and what makes him to be at peace with the sentence as he is sentenced to death.

Crito:
This is the discussion between Socrates and his friend Crito in Socrates' prison cell where he is waiting for his death penalty. The whole discussion is about Crito trying to convince Socrates to escape from prison; hence his death sentence.
Crito's motivation is not to lose his friend, but more importantly it will reflect badly on his him as people will think that with Crito didn't save his friend.
Inspite of all the attempts Crito makes, Socrates regards Athens' law very highly and does not want to break it. Also he doesn't want to eat humble pie after his respected his sentence in front of Athens. Most importantly, if he does escape, he will have made himself a hypocrite after a lifetime of teachings about justice and other virtues. Considering his old age, he is at peace with death and determined to go through with it.

Phaedo:
Is a conversation between Socrates and his friends during his last hours in this world --at least for his body--. Socrates argues the soul is immortal and that's why he is completely OK with death; because he thinks his soul will go to Hades to join gods and other high-value souls. He also regards Athens above all, so he's at peace with the sentence as it came from Athens Law. After long talks with his friends, he is ready go to Hades as a soul and leave his body in this world.

My rating: 8/10
