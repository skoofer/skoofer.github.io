This is the collection of 17 short stories —fictions— by Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. These stories are sometimes mixture of real and fantasy, and in some cases they are fully fantasy.

These stories share a common theme in a very abstract level that is fantasy and philosophy.

"Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius", "The Lottery of Babylon" and "The Library of Babel" are works of a genius. All three stories have the potential to go beyond a short story.

Though, I wasn't drawn into all of the stories —especially literary essays—. Mostly this is due to the fact that Borges' work in these particular stories are esoteric and abstract to an extent that makes them hard to follow without prior knowledge on particular topics.

Considering this is a short book, recommended to anyone to get a glimpse of Borges' work.

My rating: 7/10
